\description{
jqr: An R client for the C library jq
}
\section{Low-level}{

Low level interface, in which you can execute `jq` code just as you
would on the command line. Available via \code{\link{jq}}
}

\section{High-level DSL}{

High-level, uses a suite of functions to construct queries. Queries
are constucted, then excuted internally with \code{\link{jq}}
}

\section{Pipes}{

The high level DSL supports piping, though you don't have to use
pipes.
}

\section{NSE and SE}{

Most DSL functions have NSE (non-standard evaluation) and SE
(standard evaluation) versions, which make \code{jqr} easy to use
for interactive use as well as programming.
}

\section{jq version}{

\code{jqr} is currenlty using \code{jq v1.4}
}

\section{indexing}{

note that \code{jq} indexing starts at \code{0}, whereas R indexing
starts at \code{1}. So when you want the first thing in an array using \code{jq},
for example, you want \code{0}, not \code{1}
}
